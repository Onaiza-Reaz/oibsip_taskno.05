**Overview**

This Colab notebook implements a Decision Tree Regressor model to predict advertising sales. The model is trained on a dataset of historical advertising data, and then evaluated on a held-out test set.

**Data Preparation**

The first step is to import the necessary libraries and load the advertising dataset. The dataset is then inspected for missing values, duplicate values, and data types. Any necessary data cleaning is performed at this stage.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Once the data is prepared, it is important to perform some exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the relationships between the different variables. This is done by creating visualizations such as scatter plots to show the relationship between sales and each of the independent variables: TV, radio, and newspaper advertising.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

The next step is to split the data into training and test sets. The training set is used to train the Decision Tree Regressor model, and the test set is used to evaluate the model's performance.

To evaluate the model's performance, we use the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared metrics. The MAE measures the average difference between the predicted and actual sales values. The R-squared metric measures how well the model explains the variation in the sales data.

**Results**

The Decision Tree Regressor model achieved a MAE of 10.5% on the test set. This indicates that the model is able to predict sales values with a high degree of accuracy. The model also achieved an R-squared score of 0.95, which indicates that the model is able to explain 95% of the variation in the sales data.

**Conclusion**

The Decision Tree Regressor model is a powerful tool for predicting advertising sales. It is able to make accurate predictions, even with limited data.

**Usage**

To use the model to predict sales, simply pass the model the values of the independent variables (TV, radio, and newspaper). The model will then return a predicted sales value.

**Points to note:**

The model is trained on a dataset of historical advertising data. This means that the model is only able to predict sales based on past data.

The model is evaluated on a held-out test set. This helps to ensure that the model is not overfitting the training data.

The model achieves a MAE of 10.5% on the test set. This indicates that the model is able to predict sales values with a high degree of accuracy.

The model also achieves an R-squared score of 0.95. This indicates that the model is able to explain 95% of the variation in the sales data.

The model can be deployed to production using a variety of methods.

To use the model to predict sales, simply pass the model the values of the independent variables (TV, radio, and newspaper). The model will then return a predicted sales value.
